    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological Matter possess natural magnetic properties which can be mainipulated using a combination of magnetic disruptions and radio waves to produce KData [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "KData in itself is not useful for visualising biological features, however when an inverse discrete fourier transform (DFT) is applied to the data, the data can be visualized.\n",
    "KData contains complex numbers, therefore it must be preprocessed before visualization can occur (complex numbers made absolute). KData is held within 3 dimensions and is comprised of voxels. Each voxel contains a partition of the total kdata.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem for producing accurate Kdata is the long acquisition time, which converts to higher financial costs and inefficiency in healthcare. By using a low acquisition time, the end result is less accurate. However by applying a neural network model, the image can be accurately predicted [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, two sets of data were provided, each containing kdata.h5 files. Each H5 file contains multiple slices, which are stacked to form a 3D object.  In the test set, there were 30 low acquisition(low accuracy) H5 files, and in the training set were 70 h5 files each contain high acquisition (high accuracy). \n",
    "The original H5 files of the training set were used as the ground truth, and acted as the control of the experiment and the target output in the neural network designed.Two secondary data sets were created from undersampling the original training data, one 8-fold(high undersampled, and inaccurate), and one 4-fold(less undersampled).\n",
    "\n",
    "The undersampled was created by applying â€˜masksâ€™ to the original ground truth data, which essential removed some Kdata information, and in doing so mimicked a low acquisition data MRI scan.\n",
    "The aim of the experiment was to generate 2 neural network models using both of these undersampled sets with original target set, which can accurately convert low acquisition images to a more accurate representation, resembling that of the original ground truth set. \n",

    "# Design\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data is used to train our model and determined the parameters of the model in order to achieve the best results. But during the training process, when the bias of the data set is too high, it will cause the model we trained produce overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the role of fitting the high-frequency noise elements, large amplitudes appear when higher-order sessions accompany. In this case, the high order polynomial courses will generate the corresponding high-frequency fluctuations required [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the large deviations we see between the sampled points. This is known as overfitting which is a constant dilemma when working with the noisy datasets or a complex model. A model that overfits its training data tends to be able to generalise to unseen data and is not helpful in the process of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, validatation of the data is required to ensure that the model we perceive is the optimal one. In our design, we divide the training data set into 80% training data and 20% validation data. After training the model with training data, we use the validation data set to test all models and then select the model with the least error rate. After formulating the optimal model, we then use the test data set to test the generalized ability of the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SSIM\n",
    "\n",
    "SSIM is an index used to measure images similarity. With the use of this, we use the images received after training to compare with ground truth. SSIM measures the quality of the results from the aspects of image brightness, contrast and structure [4]. The larger the value is, the closer the result is to ground truth, which means the model is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ModelÂ¶\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, a literary search was conducted in order to identify the best platform to build upon. Two models were of interest, UNET and GAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gan  {###reduce, condense, much smaller, consise}\n",
    "\n",
    "GAN is a base model for the neural network. It is composed of a generator and a discriminator. The purpose of the generator is to generate fake targets in an attempt to completely deceive the discriminator. The discriminator improves its discrimination ability by learning the true target and the false target, so as not to let the false target fool itself. The two evolved and played against each other. Finally, the evolution stopped until the false target was very similar to the true target. However, it may generate some unpredicted results due to its unsupervised scheme and still get a high score [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "## U-net was another model of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "![unet.png](./unet.png)\n",
    "In 2015, Olaf Ronneberger and others proposed a U-net network structure. The U-net network is a semantic segmentation network based on FCN, which is suitable for medical image segmentation [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire U-Net network structure is shown in the figure above, similar to a large U letter: first convolution + Pooling down-sampling; then deconvolution for up-sampling, low-level feature map before the crop, and fusion; then up-sampling again. This process is repeated until a feature map is generated with an output of 388x388x2, and then finally obtain the output segment map through soft-max. Overall, it is very similar to the FCN idea. Unet's original intention is to solve the problems of biomedical images. This gave rise to it being widely used in various directions of semantic segmentation, such as satellite image segmentation and industrial defect detection [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "###### Advantages of U-net\n",
    "â€¢ Support for training models with a small amount of data \n",
    "\n",
    "â€¢ Get higher segmentation accuracy by classifying each pixel \n",
    "\n",
    "â€¢ Fast segmentation with trained models \n",
    "\n",
    "From the findings from literature, it was decided that UNET offered the best attributes for this specific assignment.Unet has been more established, and has yielded promising results. Furthermore, U-net has a fast processing speed and a higher segmentation accuracy, and has shown to yield good results with little data, which isn this case are valuable attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once unet was decided upon, the parameters were tested in order to identify their optimums, in doing so miniminizing loss values, and a maximizing SSIM values. This was conducted through a combination of literary search, and trial and error\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Batch Size \n",
    "\n",
    "It was reasoned an optuimum batch size for the model would be a reasonable starting point, as it would influence the speed of running further tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch size is the number of samples selected for a single training session [8]. Its size affects the degree and speed of optimization of the model. At the same time, it directly affects the GPU memory usage. When chose the best batch size, it can improve memory utilization through parallelization by enabling the GPU to run at full capacity to improve training speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the number of iterations of a single epoch is reduced and the adjustment of parameters is slow, which more epochs are required to achieve the same recognition accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, the optimimum batch size for a particular model will improve the gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimizer and learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the optimiser is highly dependent on the learning rate provided, and they do not all neccesarily have the same optimum learning rate value. Therefore each optimisation function was tested with and array of learning  rate values from 1e^-1 to 1e^-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimizers tested\n",
    "The main purpose of training a neural network is to find suitable parameters and obtain minimal loss values. The process of solving this problem is called optimization. The algorithm used to solve this problem is called optimizer. Among various optimizers, we choose three of them as listed below into our account. These three are basicly improved versions based on other optimizers, thus can achieve better result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters $\\theta$. What's more, the whole training dataset delivers a parameter update for each training example $x^{(i)}$ and label $y^{(i)}$. It prevents redundant computations for large datasets and usually processes relatively fast. However, since SGD conducts frequent updates with high variance, it can cause the objective function to fluctuate rigorously. Also, when facing local optimal where curves are much more steeply in one dimension than in another. SGD oscillates across the area and makes slow progress [9]. This leads to RMSprop.  \n",
    "$$\\theta = \\theta - \\eta \\cdot \\nabla_\\theta J ( \\theta ; x^{(i)} ; y^{(i)} ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### RMSprop\n",
    "\n",
    "For the learning rate of models, traditional optimizer either set the learning rate to a constant or adjust the learning rate based training results. All ignore the potential of the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider RMSprop as an adaptation of the rprop algorithm to learning with mini-batch. This was the original motivation for developing the algorithm. It performs low learning rates on parameters related to frequently occurring features and performs high learning rates to obtain parameters related to less commonly used features [10]. Therefore, it is very suitable for dealing with sparse data. In this way, it can greatly improve the robustness of SGD and solve the problem of the sharp drop in learning rate. It is assumed that during the $t$ iteration, each formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\n",
    "        s_{dw}= \\beta s_{dw} + (1 - \\beta)d W^2 \\\\\n",
    "        s_{db}= \\beta s_{db} + (1 - \\beta)d b^2 \\\\\n",
    "        W = W - \\alpha \\frac{dW}{\\sqrt{s_{dw}} + \\varepsilon} \\\\\n",
    "        b = b - \\alpha \\frac{db}{\\sqrt{s_{dw}} + \\varepsilon}\n",
    " }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above formula, $s_{dw}$ and $s_{db}$ are the gradient momentum accumulated by the loss function during the first $t-1$ iterations,.Respectively, $\\beta$ is an index of gradient accumulation. In order to prevent the denominator from being zero, a very small value $\\varepsilon$ is used for smoothing which generally take 1e-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RMSprop algorithm calculates the differential squared weighted average of the gradient. This method is beneficial to eliminate the direction of large swing amplitude and is used to correct the swing amplitude so that the swing amplitude in each dimension is smaller. On the other hand, it also makes the network function converge faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is a method that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter [11]. In addition to collecting past squared gradients' exponentially decaying average $v_t$, Adam also keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients $m_t$ which similar to momentum. In this way, it can flat minima in the error surface. We compute the $v_t$ and $m_t$ as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$${\n",
    "     m_t = \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + ( 1- \\beta_1) g_t \\\\\n",
    "     v_t = \\beta_2 v_{t-1} + ( 1- \\beta_2) g_t^2\n",
    " }$$\n",
    " \n",
    "If $m_t$ and $v_t$ are initialized as zero vectors, they will be biased towards 0, so a bias correction appear. It can offset these deviations by calculating the updated $m_t$ and $v_t$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\n",
    "     \\hat m_t = \\frac{m_t}{1 - \\beta_1^t} \\\\\n",
    "     \\hat v_t = \\frac{v_t}{1 - \\beta_2^t}\n",
    " }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and last upated Adam is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\n",
    "        \\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\frac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{\\hat v_t} + \\varepsilon} \\hat m_t\n",
    " }$$\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ is often to set close to $1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam is generally considered to be quite robust in the choice of hyperparameters, although the learning rate sometimes needs to be modified to default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Rates tested\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate determines how far the weights move in the gradient direction in a batch. Choosing a suitable learning rate requires constant experimentation and adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the learning rate is very small, the training will become reliable, that is, the gradient will gradually approach the minimum value. The calculated loss value will become smaller as well as the cost is that the training process will take longer. When the learning rate is very large, the training process will ignore the minimum value, showing that the loss value continuously fluctuates. In the most severe cases, it may never reach the minimum value, or even jump out of this range and fall into another sinking area [12].\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate determines how far the weights move in the gradient direction in a batch. Choosing a suitable learning rate requires constant experimentation and adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore from intailly identifying the optimum batch size, the most accurate models were identified by comparing both SSIM and loss values in the training modules for both 8f and 4f.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    " The predicted value obtained after using the model for training in the neural network needs to be compared with the ground truth so that the model can self-corrects until the difference becomes really small. With different loss functions, the influence on the model will differ too. We need to choose the most suitable function to get the most ideal model. We decided to use L1 as the orimary loss functions as: \n",
    "\n",
    "### L1 Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\n",
    "  loss(x,y)= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x-y)^2 \n",
    " }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Loss Function is used to minimize the error which is the sum of the all the absolute differences between the true value $x$ and the predicted value $y$. This Function is not affected by the outliers or remove the outliers [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing multiple loss functions would have also been a valid way to find optimum parameters to produce an accurate model. However with the time constraints is was reasoned only L1 MSE loss would be used a platform. L1 MSE loss was chosen, due to its frequent use in literature.\n",

    "The result of RMSprop was not dissimilar to the results of of ADAM. Also resulting is very similar SSIM and loss values with learning rate in 1e-4 and 1e-3 being almost identical in the table, and too insignificant to make a conclusion on the best learning rate parameter for RMSprop, both results' average SSIM Inspection of the graphs were also too similar to draw conclusions. Despite this, from visualisation of the images it appeared that 1e-3 gave slightly more detail to the image, seen by eye. Additionally, as with ADAM, the worst value shown were when learning rate was 1e-1, which indicated a too large learning rate for RMSprop to function. This trend was mirrored in 8f also, however with slightly lower results. \n",

    "As for SGD, the results of both 8F and 4F appeared to be the inverse of that of RMSprop and Adam. This displayed 1e-1 as the best result with average SSIM in 8F result in 0.57 and 0.6. Loss values were also the lowest with both 8F and 4F. Despite this, the graphs appeared to follow the normal logarithmic trends, however diminished early for Le-4 despite having the lowested value. Unlike RMSprop and Adam's worst values showing much instabilty. This trend was mirrored in 8f also, however with slightly lower results. The images we obtained also show that 1e--4 is the worst and 1e--1 is the most ideal.\n",

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, it was identified the optimum batch size was the 5. RMSprop had LR 1e-3 and LR 1e-4  as the highest values for SSIM, however not the lowest values for loss. Upon inspection of the images it appeared that RMSprop 1e-3  when comparing all images was the most detailed, and therefore was the model selected for our final reconstruction. Results are shown in the Google drive link at the top of the report. Further research may have included experients with more loss functions. Another experiment that maay have been useful for further experimentation would have been to try IBM quantum computing server to calculate a true random array for shuffling value to identify if generalization to test data would have increased.\n",
